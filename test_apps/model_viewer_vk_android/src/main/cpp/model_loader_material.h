 * @file
 * @brief  Shared material/texture helpers for the non-glTF mesh backends.
 *
 * OBJ (tinyobjloader) and FBX (ufbx) both arrive with legacy or mixed material
 * models and reference textures by external path or embedded blob. These
 * helpers do the common work: decode an image to RGBA8 and append it to
 * ModelData::textures (returning its index), and approximate a Phong specular
 * exponent as a metallic-roughness roughness. Decoding goes through
 * stbi_load_from_memory (the impl already linked from common/), matching the
 * glTF backend — textures are uploaded UNORM and sRGB-decoded in the shader.
