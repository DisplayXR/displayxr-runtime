 * @file
 * @brief  Pick the view configuration an N-view DisplayXR app must begin with.
 *
 * Issue #1486 (option B). The runtime used to report the device's MAX view
 * count (4 on sim_display) under XR_VIEW_CONFIGURATION_TYPE_PRIMARY_STEREO,
 * which is a spec deviation: PRIMARY_STEREO means exactly 2 views. It now
 * reports EXACTLY 2 under PRIMARY_STEREO and rejects an xrEndFrame whose
 * projection layer carries viewCount > 2. The device max moved to a new
 * DisplayXR view configuration,
 * XR_VIEW_CONFIGURATION_TYPE_PRIMARY_MULTIVIEW_DXR, which is enumerated after
 * PRIMARY_STEREO whenever the instance enabled XR_DXR_display_info.
 *
 * So ANY app whose per-frame view count comes from the active DXR rendering
 * mode (xrEnumerateDisplayRenderingModesDXR / the 1-2-3 mode keys), or that
 * sizes its zone tiles from the reported view count, MUST begin its session
 * with PRIMARY_MULTIVIEW_DXR — otherwise it goes black in Quad mode.
 * Stereo-fixed apps (hardcoded 2) stay on PRIMARY_STEREO and need none of this.
 *
 * Usage — one call, right after xrGetSystem() and before the first
 * xrEnumerateViewConfigurationViews() / xrBeginSession() / xrLocateViews():
 *
 *     xr.viewConfigType = DxrSelectViewConfigType(xr.instance, xr.systemId);
 *
 * and then feed that SAME variable to every view-configuration-typed call.
 * The helper degrades to PRIMARY_STEREO on an older runtime (or when
 * XR_DXR_display_info was not enabled on the instance), so it is safe to call
 * unconditionally.
 *
 * Header-only and C-compatible on purpose: the Windows cubes get it through
 * displayxr::common's XrSessionManager, the macOS/Linux/Android cubes carry
 * their own session code and apply it to their own variable.

 * ADR-041: fill the INACTIVE tail of a projection layer so the layer carries
 * the full located view count.
 *
 * The view count a session gets is fixed for its lifetime; what changes per
 * frame is how many of those views the active rendering mode actually uses
 * (chain XrViewActivityStateDXR on XrViewState to read it, or derive it from
 * the mode as these apps do). Core OpenXR still requires EVERY located view to
 * be supplied at xrEndFrame, so an app that renders only the active ones closes
 * the gap by pointing each inactive view at content it already rendered. The
 * runtime ignores those pixels.
 *
 * Each inactive view keeps its OWN located pose/fov — they are valid (the
 * runtime parks them at view 0's pose) and a pose the runtime rejects would
 * fail the layer for real. Only the subimage is aliased, onto view 0's.
 *
 * Safe to call with active >= located (does nothing).
 *
 * @param projViews  The layer's view array, sized @p located. [0, active) must
 *                   already be filled by the caller.
 * @param views      The XrView array xrLocateViews wrote, sized @p located.
 * @param located    What xrLocateViews returned (viewCountOutput).
 * @param active     Views the app actually rendered this frame.
